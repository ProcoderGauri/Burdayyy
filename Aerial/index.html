      Dear Jazzy,Today is a fighter, an inspiration </p>
      <p>and most importantly a hot tempered fathers bday</p>
      <p>I have learned so much from u these 13 years, lessons</p>
      <p>which school can never teach me. Its so amzing to see</p>
     <p> how detached you  are from things like clothes,money etc. </p>
     <p> which is something i really look upto u for, its </p>
      <p>incredible how ur such a non-khadoos  businessman, </p>
      <p>and how ur patient and trust god for everything</p>
      <p>ie. u dont question anything bad happening in your life,</p>
      <p> u take it positively as a lesson!</p>
     <p> eventhough u get frustrated a lot which is something</p>
     <p> u definately need to work on and keeping sadness </p>
      <p>to youself which u think is a noble job but honestly </p>
     <p> it isnt. You are and always will be a young kid who</p>
      <p>doesnt know everything,ie. is still learning. </p>
      <p>So you dont always need to act like a gyaani baba</p>
      <p>and batoro gyaan if u dont know anything about it </p>
     <p>Im like money and u are Harshad Mehta </p>
     <p> you can do anything to get me,</p>
    <p> Im like the electromagnet in HK metallics and u are 
     the iron scrap,u always get attracted towards me.</p>
     <p>I will  miss you when I </p>
     <p>  go to TISB, less than you will miss me OBVIOUSLY </p>
     <p> but still.Today i am being eco friendly and giving </p>
     <p> u a digital card instead of paper card which u </p>
     <p> might even throw/delete after i leave.I really hope u</p>
      <p>understand that giving your child freedom is </p>
     <p> important but so is being interested in their</p>
      <p>lives and sometimes asking them stuff about </p>
     <p> their classes and acccomplishments  on</p>
     <p> your own instaed of them telling u always is important too </p>
     <p>and checking on them, asking how their day was etc</p>
     <p> cause half of the times you dont even know if I'm alive or not</p>
     <p>  I hope you have an amazing</p>
     <p> birthday and become the positive talkative  and happy Aerial you were,</p>
      <p>start spending more time  with me and giving gossip to me and not make people </p>
     <p> scared of u and stop being so angry and frustrated on family</p>
      <p>when its your business problem and not family.</p>
      <p>I hope i managed to show my coding skillllz through this</p>
      <p>card(it took me exactly 1005 lines of code).I hope the </p>
     <p> best for u . Words can never express how much</p>
     <p>u mean to me Papa, thank u for supporting me and giving </p>
     <p> me as much freedom required to pursue everything ive ever</p>
     <p> wanted to!I wish to make u the proudest dad ever </p>
     <p> Heres to teasing mom and saving each other from her</p>
     <p>and talks about flower and kitkat </p>
     <p>Also if your wondering, I got the email ID from your status! </p>
     <p> Ok Byee, Happy Birthday!</p>
